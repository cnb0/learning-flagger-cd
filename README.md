 - Flagger is a Kubernetes operator that automates the promotion of canary deployments 
   using Istio, Linkerd, App Mesh, NGINX, Contour or Gloo routing for traffic shifting and 
   Prometheus metrics for canary analysis

```
- Flagger can run automated application analysis, promotion and rollback for the following deployment strategies:

      Canary Release (progressive traffic shifting)
                  Istio, Linkerd, App Mesh, NGINX, Contour, Gloo
      A/B Testing (HTTP headers and cookies traffic routing)
                  Istio, App Mesh, NGINX, Contour
      Blue/Green (traffic switching)
                  Kubernetes CNI, Istio, Linkerd, App Mesh, NGINX, Contour, Gloo
      Blue/Green Mirroring (traffic shadowing)
                  Istio
